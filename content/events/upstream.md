A 100% virtual, completely free event bringing together like-minded application developers, open source project maintainers, 
and the extended network of people who care most about their work.

This year, keynote speakers include Aeva Black of the Azure Office at Microsoft, Deb Bryant of Red Hat, and John Mark Walker of Fannie Mae. 
Attendees will once again have the opportunity to meet maintainers behind the open source tools they use every day and learn from industry legends
developing applications with open source at scale.
